            <p>The RISD Christian Fellowship is open to all students from any background interested in learning more about Christianity. Being a Christian group, we do rely on the Gospel and we meet weekly to provide a casual and open place on campus to study its teachings and application in our daily lives. We believe in the benefits of being involved in a supportive community like ours, and we hope our group can help foster a caring and compassionate environment for the general campus community, not just those personally invested in the Christian faith.</p>
